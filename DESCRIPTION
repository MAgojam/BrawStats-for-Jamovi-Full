Description: This implements BrawStats in Jamovi.
    BrawStats is software intended for teaching the principles of statistics.
    It simulates data in a wide variety of situations.
    One thing that students like is the ability to make a data set in BrawStats, see the correct analysis of it and then replicate that analysis for themselves in the main Jamovi modules.
